# Implementation of RFC8439 for my advanced crypto course

Please find the code in the files:
    Chacha20.py
    Poly1305.py
    AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305.py
    utils.py

You may run the demo script demo.py for a small demonstration.

You also may run the test scripts (run all_tests.py) to simply run the code with most of the tests vectors provided in the RFC.
